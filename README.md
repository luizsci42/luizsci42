### My Experience
    Hi there! I'm Luiz Felipe and I'm cunrrently working as Machine Learning Engineer at Grupo Boticário
    and undegraduating on Computer Science at Universidade Federal de Sergipe.
    
    I have a previous expericence as Data Scientist and Business Intelligence Analyst at Secretaria de 
    Estado da Fazenda de Sergipe, by SergipeTec (Sergipe Parque Tecnológico).
    
    I also had made some projects at Ludiico Labs, an academic group inside the university, on which 
    I had aquired experience mainly on Natural Language Processing and Data Science, and also on 
    Android Development and FUllStack Development with ReactJS and NodeJS.
    
    In all these projects, I used to be very proactive and criative, collaborating not only with the
    development, but also with sugestions, solutions and new strategies when something went wrong.
    
    My interests include Ethical technology development, Data Science, Creative Writing and Inovation.

### What I believe in
    I believe that the technological development must derease social inequality and empower people and nations,
    serving to people interests, not only to enrich limited groups. Besides, technology must be developed with 
    harmony with nature, as a tool to mitigate envinomental impacts and helping to nature preservation.
    
    Moreover, I believe in a collaborative culture. The Internet and technologies must contribuite to spread the
    Human knowledge, not only the knowledge of certains groups and nations, but as a way of preserve and spread
    traditional and marginalized epistemologies.
    
<!--
At my job, I work with processes and tools of Business Intelligence, as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load),
reporting with dashboards and training of machine learning models.
